This is a calucator app with gui. it is a simple practice programing exercise.

I used Eclipse to code and WindowBuilder in Eclipse to build GUI elements.

This uses the MVC model. Probably not used right.

This will be tweeked accordingly as I progress in the functionality.

The GUI elements will be tweeked once the functionality is mostly complete.

To Do:

add keyListener funcuionality to relevant keyboard keys

straighten gui buttons to grid(?)
